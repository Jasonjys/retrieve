This week I worked on:
1.Add edit and remove list item functionality in the profile page.
2.Add profile edit page so that the user can change name or the profile icon


The challenges that I facedï¼š
Since the component that change the profile icon should work the same as the component that upload image in the post form page, I am 
finding a way to make the CameraComponent reusable so that I can use it for changing the profile icon
