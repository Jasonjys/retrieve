This week I worked on:
1.Add error message on the create post form
2.Add more imformation on the list, such as date and address.
3.Fix bug in map
4.Add Bottom sheet component for displaying one of the list items detail when user long pressing it.

The challengs that I faced:
The callout in the map component that Airbnb working on is buggy, so we need to come up a way to not using the callout of the marker to show the imformation of that item detail
