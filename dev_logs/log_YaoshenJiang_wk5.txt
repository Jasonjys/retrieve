This week I worked on:
1. PostForm should create a post object on firebase and I need to store it in firebase.
2. User should has an array of id point to the posts he owns.
3. Design the PostForm component so we can reuse it for lost/found post.
4. Team discussed how user can search for the post

Challenges:

2. how to use expo camera component so that user is able to select and take photo of the item
3. What filter can user apply? Can user only apply single filter or muiltyple filters?
4. What data should be sent to the server for searching?
