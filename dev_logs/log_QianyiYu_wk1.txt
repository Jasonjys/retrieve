This week I worked on:
1. Create post page, add input fields for title, description, tags and component to upload image by using camera or choosing from the camera library.
2. Citem detail imformation page, displaying title, description, tags and image, created mock datas for testing.

The challenges that I faced:
At first I have no idea how to upload image using expo. And then I searched a useful component on Github and spend a long time to figure it out how it actually work, finally we found a good photo upload component to use.
