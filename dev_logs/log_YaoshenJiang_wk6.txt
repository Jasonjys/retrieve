This week I worked on:
1. Mainly working on PostForm component
2. User is now able to create new post
3. User is now able to delete their post
4. UI styling
5. Trying to figure out how we can upload image and store them

Challenges:
1. It seems like we cannot use firebase's image storage service since expo does not support the feature
2. Found an example expo image uploading server code. Need to understand how it works so we can use it.
