This week I worked on:
1.Fix the map layout, create bottom touchable hightlight to display the chosen item detail or the entire list
2.Remove tag component since we don't need it anymore
3.Add long press functionality on the list item so that user can long press the list item so that the location jump to the chosen item's marker location
4.Add category picker on create post form so that user can choose the category of the item

The challenges that I faced:
I tried to add the image zoom functionality but all the component that I search on Google are not good enough, the animation is buggy and slow.
