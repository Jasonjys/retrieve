This week I worked on:
1. Routing makes a lot more sense now to me. Navigation starts working.
2. Still working on facebook login.
3. I need to get the user facebook image to show in the profile page.
4. Unable to get facebook email from the user.

Challenges:
1. I need to make Facebook login and redirecting to work. But it is very confusing.
2. Styling is annoying and time consuming.
