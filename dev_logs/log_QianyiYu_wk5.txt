This week I worked on:
1.Fix the category picker bug
2.Fix the style of the swipe list in the profile page
3.Seperate all the style from the component into a single file


The challenges that I faced:
I am working to adding edit and remove list item functionality in the user profile page, there is one bug I am fixing, which is when user swipe a list item to left it will show two buttons on the right,
and if he swipe the other list item, the previous buttons should hide, it seems like a bug in this component, still working on it.
